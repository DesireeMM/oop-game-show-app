#### <a name="styling"></a>CSS Styling
As an added challenge, I've changed up some of the default styling.
- The "win" CSS class that gets attached to the initial loading screen now adds a background image instead of changing the background color. Here's a link to the [win background image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/golden-statuette-and-stars-on-yellow-background-6532373/) I chose.
- The "lose" CSS class that gets attached to the initial loading screen now adds a background image instead of changing the background color. Here's a link to the [lose background image](https://unsplash.com/photos/Fp4ERdkR5jU) I chose.
- Because the image I chose for the lose class has a light background, the headings were hard to read. To combat this, I changed the text color of the headings to a dark blue.
- Similarly, I reversed the colors of the button to make it stand out against the image.
